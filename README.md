# CSO Website Project

This repository is created and maintained by the students of East Stroudsburg University's Computer Science Organization.

This project represents the webpage to our [website](https://esucso.org/).

The project is a great oppourtunity to hone key development skills and we wish to emulate a real development team as much as possible.

ESU students or alumni can contact a CSO representative (link pending) if you are interesting in being added.

Students are encouraged to create [issues](https://github.com/esucsowt/website/issues) and contribute.
